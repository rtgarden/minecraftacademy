Horse Challenge:
==================

like NPC villages horses tend to appear in flatter biome terrains

the plains and savannahs (no peaceful mobs spawn in the desert)

the first step is to tame a horse, by riding it again and again until it doesnt throw you off,

very similar to how colts or wild horses are "broken".

Horses will accept various foods for taming help: Sugar, Wheat, Bread, apple, *golden apple, golden carrot

Once 2 horses are tamed the horses can be bred together using (2) golden apples

Prior to riding off with your horse leaving its initial herd behind,

it is best to breed it and replace it since passive mobs do not regenerate quickly (anymore)

instead passive mobs are dependent on breeding for population.
