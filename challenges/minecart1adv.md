Advanced Minecraft Academy Minecart/railway/farm Challenge #1
========================================

create a railway system that allows you to map a new territory

create an auto harvesting wheat field activated by: detector rail or activator rail

make it so the field is harvested as you drive by in the minecart

optimally it should harvest as you arrive so that you can re-plant the field

since most farming is only partially auto and still neccesitates hand planting

additionally wheat/carrots/potatoes are all local chunk memory dependent so other

activities should be nearby for timely results. 

 
 the contents of the field need to be collected into a chest using hoppers
 
 Create a system of collection using hopper carts, chest carts, and some sort
 
 of track system that can allow a furnace fueled connected set of carts
 
 to retrive the chest contents and deliver them to your house or farm
 
 
 
 extra points for creating a system at your house that auto stores the
 
 contents of the carts (either chest or hopper) into a storage chest.
