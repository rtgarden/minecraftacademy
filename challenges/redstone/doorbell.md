redstone challenge easy level 1:
================================

create a pressure plate linked to a noteblock

make the pressure plate outside your house where monsters roam

and the noteblock inside or in the wall where you are safe

connect them with redstone dust using repeaters if dust trail is over 15 blocks

additional challenge:
---------------------

*create a more complex sound:

make a sequence of notes: at least three

*create a more complex sensor system:

create three different pressure plates with three different notes

this way you can tell by the note which plate is activated


Monster Traps
-------------

with the increased monster AI with 1.7.4 update this system could be used

to let you know that monster mobs have moved into certain

combat zones where you can use special shooting portals

and door locks to have easy combat and gain experience.

Additionally a pressure plate connected to a piston system could push

the mob into a drop accesible from inside the house

now that mobs do not easily fall (the old mob drop systems are not really good anymore)
