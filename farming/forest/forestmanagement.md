Forest Trees Wood
=================

wood is a key component in minecraft in many crafted items.

The very first thing most people do on their first day of survival is "punch wood"

in order to begin making tools and weapons.

trees do not plant themselves and pretty muc the seed generated trees are all that you get

by carefull collecting and cultivating the various types of trees you can get

quite a variety of wood.

trees can be cultivated in protected arboretums

saplings can always be used as fuel if you feel you are overloaded

trees respond erratically to bonemeal fertilizing
