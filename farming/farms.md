several types of farming systems help you in the game:

wheat farm

potato and carrot farm (related to villages)

pumpkin and melon farm

cactus farm

tree farm

these can all be created indoors with lots of light to use them without

having to worry about mobs

the cavern must be at leat 5 blocks high 8 or 12 is better


MOB farming:

passive mobs : sound consideration

they are pretty loud generally

chickens are the easiest as you can carry stacks of eggs

mobs do not replenish well naturally, breeding to replace those killed.

you can get bones, string and leather as trash in your fishing drops.
