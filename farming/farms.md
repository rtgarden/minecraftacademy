Types of farming systems :
====================================================

these can all be created indoors with lots of light so you can use them without

having to worry about mobs. Torches and jack o lanterns provide light


Need adjacent water (and light level 9 or more)
-----------------------------------------------

wheat, sugar cane, carots, potatoes, pumkin, melon

(if possible alternate rows)

water is generally gathered from a spring or ocean with a bucket and placed in

irrigation networks, however of course existing water can be used for ad hoc farming.

"Water will travel a distance of 8 tiles with the counter resetting to 0 every time it lands on a lower level"

this rule from the wiki means that every 7 blocks if there is a drop the water renews its flow

this creates terraced fields 7 deep for auto-harvesting.

water will irrigate out for 4 blocks, the most simple farm is a 9square field with one water block in the center.

lily pads can be used to step on when placed on water

dry tilled land around the edge of the planted field increases the vitality of the crops at the edge of the field

crops (except cane) can be cultivated on dry tilled dirt they jusy grow very slow


Auto Harvesting Tactics:
=========================

water
-----

Auto harvesting with water displaces wheat, carrots and potatoes

(as well as grass and rail), the water can be controlled with pistons

or it can be placed and retreived by dispensers with water buckets in them. This does

not revert the tilled state of the land back to untilled. 

Water can be used to convey the items into a hopper, and also using a hopper into a chest.

pistons
-------

pistons can be used to control water flow,

pistons also by moving the tilled dirt blocks harvest the crops planted on them

pistons can also be used directly on the crop on the block, however this

destroys the tilled state of the land so that it has to be worked with a hoe.


usually water is also used with the piston systems to channel the resulting crops

into a hopper/chest.


Farm types:
===========

wheat farm
-----------

(seed source tall grass,)

harvesting wheat yields seeds and wheat

seeds are used to breed chickens

wheat is used to breed cows and sheep, and tame horses

wheat can be crafted into haybales

wheat can be crafted into bread using 3 wheat on a crafting table



potato farm
=============

(source NPC villages, rare zombie drop)

carrot farm 
==========

(source NPC villages, rare zombie drop) used to breed pigs, 

a crafted golden carrot can steer a saddled pig

carrots also help tame horses



pumpkin farm
------------

not good for water harvest method

(source wild pumpkins found in several biomes, seeds in chests)

pumkins crafted with sugar and egg make an edible pie

seeds are crafted on a grid

pumkins are best harvested with an ax

pistons can be used to harvest pumpkins and push them into hoppers

pumpkins crafted with torches make jackolanterns a unique lighting source

which is itself a building block, and can illuminate underwater.

a pumpkin can be worn as a helmet that protects agains endermen

melon farm
===========

not good for water harvest method

melons can be crafted into golden melon slices using golden nuggets and one slice

these can be brewed into healing potions

(source wild melon, found in the jungle, seeds in chests, villagers)

no preffered tool

melons can be sliced, slices can be eaten. each slice can be crafted for seeds

pistons can be used to break melons into a hopper collector



Other Botanicals:
=================


Flowers
-------

instantly grass and some flowers appear when you put bonemeal on plain grass dirt blocks

flowers do not spread or reproduce themselves.

right clicking larger flowers with bonemeal makes a copy of the plant.

flowers can be crafted into dyes



Sugar Canes farm:
=================

sugar canes are three high and if you leave the bottom block they will regrow

must be planted on grass, dirt and sand adjacent to water

cane is crafted into sugar which is a component of pumkin pie and cake.

Sugar canes can be crafted into paper

are a component of some potions and fireworks rockets

paper is made into books with leather and together with planks books create bookcases

bookcases foem enchantment tables

does not respond to bonemeal

can be placed underwater creating airlocks

can block the flow of lava and water

arrows pass through sugar cane

snow and ice will uproot sugar canes

removing the water source will also uproot them allowing auto harvest



Cactus farm:
=============

cactus are 3 high, and if you leave the base block they regrow

must be planted on sand

overhanging blocks can break off cactus as it grows making easy gathering

using hoppers this can be continuous

cactus can be crafted into dye

cactus can create a unique defensive fence against hostile mobs

does not respond to bonemeal

position dependent: only grow when chunk is loaded meaning player is nearby

tree farm
=========

farmed on dirt, needs space,

the cavern must be at leat 5 blocks high, 8 or 12 is better

trees are crafted to create wood which is used in numerous crafting recipes

saplings can be planted or used as furnace fuel

wood can be smelted into charcoal

saplings are position dependent: only grow when chunk is loaded meaning player is nearby

using shears you can gather leaf blocks

breaking leaf blocks or waiting for them to decay may yeild saplings

when breaking dark oak apples may be dropped as well as saplings

apples can be used to tame horses

apples can be crafted into golden apples

golden apples have magical protective properties

golden apples can be used to breed TAMED horses.

Coco Farm
==========

farmed on logs




mushroom farm
============

dirt and even stone in low light levels

mushrooms spread autonomously to adjacent blocks.

they can be easily propagated underground in mines.

Vines
=======

found in swamp and jungle biomes

can be collected with water

can be placed against a solid block and will grow

vines on a solid block can be climbed like ladders

collected with shears

vines block the vision of mobs yet can have arrows shot through them

vines grow in any light level

best harvested in sections from the bottom up

bonemeal does not work

vines are best kept out of animal breeding areas as the mobs climb them and take damage falling


Lily Pads
=========

generated in swamp biomes and a collected botanical.

can be collected as fishing "trash" so are renewable

not really farmable however quite useful on the farm as a water bridge.


Nettherrack
============

needs soul sand, found in the nether


Other Types of non botanical Farming:
====================================

Ice farm
========

Music disc
==========


MOB farming:
============

passive mobs : sound consideration

they are pretty loud generally

chickens are the easiest as you can carry stacks of eggs

mobs do not replenish well naturally, breeding to replace those killed.

you can get bones, string and leather as trash in your fishing drops.
