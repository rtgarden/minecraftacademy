several types of farming systems help you in the game:

wheat farm

potato and carrot farm (related to villages)

pumpkin and melon farm

tree farm

these can all be created indoors with lots of light to use them without

having to worry about mobs


MOB farming:

passive mobs : sound consideration

they are pretty loud generally

chickens are the easiest as you can carry stacks of eggs

mobs do not replenish well naturally, breeding to replace those killed.

you can get bones, string and leather as trash in your fishing drops.

aggressive mob farming often includes mechanisms which "grind" the mobs into drops

thus they are called "mob grinders"

you can also set up traps and paths

some home defense systems have included ways to deal with mobs

the older way was using "murder holes" and some drops to kill mobs

the mob AI is smarter than that so new methods are being developed

some of the new tactics include using the MOBs need to follow a path to get to you

one of my recent ideas is a door system that would send mobs towards you and allow tripwires to

detonate arrows in a dispenser
