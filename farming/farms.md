Types of farming systems :
====================================================


need adjacent water (and light level 9 or more)
---------------------------------

wheat, sugar cane, carots, potatoes, pumkin, melon

(if possible alternate rows)

water is generally gathered from a spring or ocean with a bucket and placed in

irrigation networks, however of course existing water can be used for ad hoc farming.

"Water will travel a distance of 8 tiles with the counter resetting to 0 every time it lands on a lower level"

this rule from the wiki means that every 7 blocks if there is a drop the water renews its flow

this creates terraced fields 7 deep for auto-harvesting with water which displaces wheat, carrots and potatoes

(as well as grass and rail)

water will irrigate out for 4 blocks, the most simple farm is a 9square field with one water block in the center.

lily pads can be used to step on

Farm types:
===========

wheat farm (seed source tall grass, wheat harvest)

potato farm (source NPC villages, rare zombie drop)

carrot farm (source NPC villages, rare zombie drop)

pumpkin farm (source wild pumpkins on a crafting grid)

melon farm (sorce wild melon,)

sugar cane farm:
=================

must be planted on sand

cactus farm:
=============

must be planted on sand

tree farm
=========

these can all be created indoors with lots of light to use them without

having to worry about mobs

the cavern must be at leat 5 blocks high 8 or 12 is better

mushroom farm
============

ice farm
========




MOB farming:
============

passive mobs : sound consideration

they are pretty loud generally

chickens are the easiest as you can carry stacks of eggs

mobs do not replenish well naturally, breeding to replace those killed.

you can get bones, string and leather as trash in your fishing drops.
