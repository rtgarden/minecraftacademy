noteblocks:
===========

made with redstone and planks

different planks give a different surface

basic diagram
=============

http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Note_block

the tone is set by the number of right clocks on the block

a total of 0-12 clicks completes one octave

instrumental tone
==================

set by the block type underneath the note block:

bass guitar: wood blocks including another note block

snare drum: sand,gravel, soul sand

clicks/sticks: glass

bass drum: bricks, stone based blocks, obsidian, nettherrack

piano/ harp: air, dirt all other blocks.

other rules
============

note blocks need a block of space aove them

redstone should therefore be set to power them from the sides or bottom.

a switch on the side of a block interferes with the sound

multiple notes can be powered at once creating chords

the visual note is visible for 18 blocks

the audible note is heard for 47 blocks

note blocks cannot be pushed by pistons



songs
========

using redstone repeaters and redstone comparators along with sequencing the notes you can make a complete song

adding in chords and percussion can make a full sound.
