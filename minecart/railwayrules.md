these are ratios for laying tracks
==================================

regular track to powered tracks:

Flat Runway, Occupied car = 1:37

Flat Runway, Unoccupied car = 1:7 or 1:8 (1:8 works but it's slow)

Uphill, Occupied car = 1:2

Uphill Unoccupied car = 1:1

(occupied cars have more momentum. occupied means a mob or person)

powered rails need a redstone torch or lever/button to activate them

alternatively and activator rail can be used
