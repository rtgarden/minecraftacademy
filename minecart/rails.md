Creating Railway systems in Minecraft:
======================================

this brings together several activities and in survival mode can be quite challenging.

a sequence of challenges must be completed in order to produce enough crafted

rail by mining iron and gold and smelting it.

using redstone also you can make the initial powered, detector and activator rails

for making the initial rails used in the glitch machine.

you will have to mine enough iron for the regular rail as it does not

duplicate in survival mode through a glitch



The Glitch:
==========

in order to help create materials you can create mechanisms that rely on the glitch:

*cobblestone generator

*rail generators using sticky piston glitch (1.7.4 tested) make powered, detector, and activator rails.

powered and detector rails can be alternated to good effect.



 It may be possible to use the activator rail as part of the sequence, especially if it involves a
 
 minecart chest powered by a furnace by minecart which delivers materials through a hopper to a chest in your station

some players have developed elaborate systems of item sorting in these special sections of their station

Making Railways with powered and detector rails:
===============================================

regular rails are needed for:

switching tracks

going around curves

rails can be alternated with powered railn and detector rail

simply use regular rails when 

you want to come to a stop.




glitch fabrication
-------------------


rail generator glitch machine 1.7.4


in order to start out making a glitch machine you have to have

several resource based components:

minecarts

for the glitch machine:

1 glass block

3 redstone torches

3 regular rails

2 sticky pistons

12 blocks

powered rail

alternator rail (etc to be duplicated)

start with a station using a powered rail and a button or switch

always use many powered rails going uphill

there is a limit to the number of powered rails in a row that you can use without a detector rail

around 12

you can power powered rail with levers and buttons,

as well as redstone torches in addition to detector rails

remember torches are broken by snow,

and rails are removed by flowing water so be careful of water flow

a common ratio is 1 powered rail to every 25 regular rails

(be careful of the directions of travel and the influence of south and east)


Switching Rails
----------------

simple switching mechanism can use a lever

the lever powers the movement of regular rails which are used for switching

a button can also be used for selection of destination systems

fancy switching mechanisms can include entrances for chest carts and hoppers which

are seperate from the ones used by players and detected using trapped carts
