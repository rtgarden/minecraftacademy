creating Railway systems in Minecraft:
======================================

this brings together several activities and in survival mode can be quite challenging.

in order to help create materials you can create mechanisms that rely on the glitch:

*cobblestone generator

*rail generators using sticky iston glitch (1.7.4 tested) make powered, detector, and activator rails.

powered and detector rails can be alternated to good effect.



 It may be possible to use the activator rail as part of the sequence, especially if it involves a
 
 minecart chest powered by a furnace by minecart which delivers materials through a hopper to a chest in your station



Making Railways with powered and detector rails:
===============================================

regular rails are needed for:

switching tracks

going around curves

rails can be alternated with powered railn and detector rail

simply use regular rails when 

you want to come to a stop.




glitch fabrication
-------------------


rail generator glitch machine 1.7.4


in order to start out making a glitch machine you have to have

several resource based components:

minecarts

for the glitch machine:

1 glass block

3 redstone torches

3 regular rails

2 sticky pistons

12 blocks

powered rail

alternator rail (etc to be duplicated)

start with a station using a powered rail and a button or switch

always use many powered rails going uphill

a common ratio is 1 powered rail to every 25 regular rails

be careful of the directions of travel and the influence of south and east

switching rails
----------------

simple switching mechanism can use a lever

the lever powers the movement of regular rails which are used for switching

a button can also be used for selection of destination systems

fancy switching mechanisms can include entrances for chest carts and hoppers
