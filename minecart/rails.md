creating Railway systems in Minecraft:
======================================

this brings together several activities and in survival mode can be quite challenging.

in order to help create materials you can create mechanisms that rely on the glitch:

cobblestone generator


rails can be alternated with powered railn and detector rail, thereby saving redstone, simply use regular rails when 

you want to come to a stop. It may be possible to use the activator rail as part of the sequence.




glitch fabrication
-------------------


rail generator glitch machine 1.7.4


in order to start out making a glitch machine you have to have

several resource based components:

minecarts

for the glitch machine:

1 glass block

3 redstone torches

3 regular rails

2 sticky pistons

12 blocks

powered rail

alternator rail (etc to be duplicated)

start with a station using a powered rail and a button or switch

always use many powered rails going uphill

a common ratio is 1 powered rail to every 25 regular rails

be careful of the directions of travel and the influence of south and east

switching rails
----------------

simple switching mechanism can use a lever

fancy switching mechanisms can include entrances for chest carts and hoppers
