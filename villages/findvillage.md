Finding NPC Villages 
====================

villages are built with the seed in three different  primarily flat and sparsely wooded biomes:

Plains- rolling hills grass covered, many mobs including horses,

(sunflowers may preclude a village)

Savannah-no rain, horses spawn, also Cows and Sheep. Acacia trees.

(large outcroppings may preclude villages Savannah M, not sure about plateau)

Desert- no rain, no passive mobs, cactus, sand, desert temples also desert wells

(possibly the presence of much water rules out a village desert M)
