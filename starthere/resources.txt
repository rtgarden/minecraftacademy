for screencaps in minecraft use F2, to make the toolbar dissapear use F1

sometimes on Mac fn+F2 or fn+F1 is the right combination.

this will create a date and time stamped .ping file

 	~/Library/Application Support/minecraft/screenshots is the image location for Mac OSX


day 1

start out by crafting a crafting table, furnace, and double chest inside of a protective shelter

near your spawn point.

immediately craft a set of wooden tools, primarily a sword and a pick.

dig around and expand your base a little during your first night,

use the furnace to smelt some coal if you do not have any

make lots of torches

spend one more days gathering yourself together

make sure that you have a cobbestone axe, and pick, and sword at least by the end of the first day,

locate any peaceful mobs, do not kill any yet.


at night you will encounter different mobs and sounds learn to differentiate between them

The first mob you want to kill is a spider if possible

we really want to get 2 spider threads from killing spiders

crafting a fishing pole from them FIRST

this might drop from one spider or two

spiders also drop spider eyes sometimes, save it for later in your chest.

you may want to develop your base for the first few days along with fishing.

Build a base:
==========

crafting table, chests, furnace

a door with a view so monsters do not ambush you

a way to protect from spiders

once you have 2 wool from killing sheep (or shearing them) you can build a bed

sleeping in a bed at night you avoid monsters and fewer spawn overall.

fishing:
=======

since 1.7 fishing can bring you cool junk

fish and even treasure.

The best part is you also get experience points

which you will need later for enchantments and tool repair

as well as brewing potions and naming objects.

you can get enchanted bows, fishing poles and books fishing,

it is worth the time and it gives you a chance to get used to the game sounds.

you will need a fishing shack to protect your back with a door

might as well have a furnace and crafting table and chest as well.

sometimes you catch boots you can put these on right away.
