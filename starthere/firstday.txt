include basic directions ofr surviving your first night in minecraft on survival mode.

alternatively on creative mode you can follow the directions to make your first shelter
 near your spawn point and outfitting it with a few basic features.
 
 a crafting area with furnace and chest
 
 a door, with pressure plate or switch
 
 a perimeter system with a gate or door way entrance.
 
 
 start using one of the five selected seeds.
 
 for study use the "survive and thrive" series on youtube
 
 these directions are for minecraft 1.7 on a PC.
 
 the versions for handheld devices and the free version are both in "creative" mode
 
 for this part of the academy series I would like to start out in survival mode 
 
 where there are also game acheivements that are awarded.
 
 using this approach you can use the acheivements to mark your progress with some of the lessons.
