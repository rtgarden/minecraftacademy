Aggressive MOBs: 
==============

hostile mobs in minecraft mostly come out at night

without any armor on, they can easily pretty much kill you.

each mob has special qualities that make them  a challenge:

----------
 spawns in light level less than (7) blocks, does not burn in sunlght, wanders into the day
 
 (often despawns around noon), they will chase a player they see within (16)blocks
 
 within (1) block of the player they hiss and explode creating a crater of exploded materials
 
 unless the player moves 3 or more blocks away in less than 1.5 sec. Can climb ladders and vines.
 
 
 
 drops: gunpowder, music discs if shot by a skeleton.
 
 spiders:
 ---------
 
 pursue a player withing 16(blocks), can see through blocks, can climb and jump. 
 
 becomes nuetral in daylight level 10 or more. 
 
 is two blocks wide and can go through a one block high opening. Best use a stone or metal sowrd at least,
 
 bows are quite effective from a distance.

 cave spiders:
 -------------

skeletons: (undead)
------------
can shoot at you from (15) blocks away and chase you from (16). They will burn in sunlight unless wearing a helmet or standing in water.

Skeletons sometimes have enchanted bows, armor, weapons, and shoot flaming arrows. 

surface skeletons only spawn if the player does not sleep in a bed at night.

Drops: bones, arrows, rarely a bow or armor.


zombies: (undead) sees player (60) blocks
--------

a slow moving mob that can pick up items and use them, as well as spawn with armor and weapons. Burns in sunlight.

spawns in groups of 1-6, and will follow an open path to the player avoiding simple traps. Behaves as a horde.  Damaged zombies

summon other zombies nearby, and may cause many zombies to spawn (since 1.7.4).

Zombies can "see" through windows. They are the most common mob spawning easily in dimply lit places.

surface zombies only spawn if the player does not sleep in a bed at night.


baby zombies:
------------
Zombies and zombie villagers can also spawn in a baby zombie version, which can climb up ladders

as well as through a single block hole. They can also spawn riding a chicken as babyzombie chicken jockeys.

They are faster than normal zombies and they do not burn in sunlight.



curing a zombie villager 
-----------------------

zombie villagers can be cured with a golden apple, by right clicking them with it.

they must be sheilded from the sun, other zombies or their tendency to fight during the 2-5min transformation 

into being a villager again.

zombie drops:

rotten flesh, whatever it is carrying, sometimes carrot or potato, rarely weapons or armor,


Protecting your village from zombies:
-------------------------------------

zombie seiges used to be the norm in the game: if you stay in a village overnight or stay

within (128) blocks of a village extra zombies will spawn and attack the village and villagers (and you). Zombies attack 

villagers within (30) blocks, and may seige if the village has 40+ villagers.
