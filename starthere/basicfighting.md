Fighting MOBs:
==============

hostile mobs in minecraft mostly come out at night

without any armor on, they can easily pretty much kill you.

each mob has special qualities that make them  a challenge:


skeletons: can shoot at you from (X) blocks away. They will burn in sunlight unless wearing armor.

they cannot climb a 2 block step, or fit through a single block hole
