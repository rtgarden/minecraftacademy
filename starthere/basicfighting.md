Fighting MOBs:
==============

hostile mobs in minecraft mostly come out at night

without any armor on, they can easily pretty much kill you.

each mob has special qualities that make them  a challenge:


skeletons:
------------
can shoot at you from (15) blocks away and chase you from (16). They will burn in sunlight unless wearing a helmet or standing in water.

Skeletons sometimes have enchanted bows and shoot flaming arrows. Drops: bones, arrows, rarely a bow or armor.


zombies:
--------
