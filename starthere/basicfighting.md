Fighting MOBs:
==============

hostile mobs in minecraft mostly come out at night

without any armor on, they can easily pretty much kill you.

each mob has special qualities that make them  a challenge:


skeletons:
------------
can shoot at you from (15) blocks away and chase you from (16). They will burn in sunlight unless wearing a helmet or standing in water.

Skeletons sometimes have enchanted bows, armor, weapons, and shoot flaming arrows. 

surface skeletons only spawn if the player does not sleep in a bed at night.

Drops: bones, arrows, rarely a bow or armor.


zombies:
--------

a slow moving mob that can pick up items and also spawn with armor and weapons.


baby zombies:
------------
Zombies and zombie villagers can also spawn in a baby zombie version, which can climb up ladders

as well as through a single block hole. They can also spawn riding a chicken as babyzombie chicken jockeys.

They are faster than normal zombies.



curing a zombie village
-----------------------

zombie villagers can be cured with a golden apple, by right clicking them with it.

they must be sheilded from the sun, other zombies or their tendency to fight during the 2-5min transformation 

into being a villager again.
