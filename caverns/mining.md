basic ideas and methods of mining:
==================================

the basic method is to illuminate to the right so that you can find your way out.

another good tactic is to periodically make doors to section off the mined so random monster attacks are lessened

you can use colored wool and various colors of plank to mark the direction out

torches at the end of a cavern to indicate a monster cavern

use glass blocks to surround monster caverns and even intersect them.

regular crafting stations with chests and furnaces are a good idea.



diamond ore is usually found between level 10-16, I have found it in level 1-5 so basically it is below level 16.


you can place blocks when falling, and gravel can be used this way as well as scaffolding for access to walls.
