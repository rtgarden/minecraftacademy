Gaming Concepts for parents who have little gaming history
===========================================================

*spawn point-your rebirth location

*experience points-little green orbs

*health points- hearts and hits

*mobs

*NPC- non player characters. In this case villagers. NPC differ from MOBS in minecraft because you can have

trading interactions with NPC.  Trading with villagers allws access to some very rare items and to

a special potion that gives experience points. You can trade regularly gleaned and crafted items

like books, steak, fish and wheat to villagers for emeralds, and eventually emeralds for other things.

The villagers now have roles that correspond to their trading interests. Example: librarian wants books,

butcher wants steak and so on.

*inventory control- the game uses a system of chests and hoppers to keep the players inventory

in safe places, and handy for various activities. Chests can be joined together into double chests.

chests can also be placed in minecarts and onto donkeys for mobile inventory. There are also methods of transporting

items using item elevators that allow movement from one chest to another usually using hoppers.

*Boss battles- In many games there are several boss battles which require preparation and the

acquisition of special tools or keys to access the boss battle site. Minecraft now has a boss battle in the form of the

enderdragon which is in its own dimension accesible from a special stronghold. There are other opponents which are

especially difficult, in the nether the ghast and the blaze could be considered as mini boss battles.

The blaze in particular is spawned in fortressess in the nether and yeilds blaze rods, an ingredient

neccesary to craft a potion brewing stand.
