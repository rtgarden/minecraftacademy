use of maps in minecraft
==========================

maps are blank until opened and right clicked

maps can be fit together on a wall if they are carefully made

maps can reveal generated structures like villages and witch huts

maps update as you use them and move around

maps can be scoped out several times by placing paper arund them on a crafting table

maps can be cloned

maps which are posted on a mapboard show on their clones

maps must be filled in by moving around the territory, either above or below ground


a good map strategy:
====================


make a clone of the first map you make of the spawn point

then expand a clone map once and fill it in and clone it

do this until you have a room with several views of your immediate area
