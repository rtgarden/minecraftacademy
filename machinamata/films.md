minecraft can be used to make simple short films.

using online recording software you can record your gameplay

playing in creative mode you can build elaborate sets as a group in group mode

soundscape can be created during play or edited in post production

minecraft worlds can be imported into blender 3D where they can provide sets which can be

filmed using camera/lighting abilities in blender which are very good.
