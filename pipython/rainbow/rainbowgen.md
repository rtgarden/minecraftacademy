my first scrit for minecraft API:

http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/1638036-my-first-script-for-minecraft-pi-api-a-rainbow/

directions from site:


Put into the api/python folder, then, cd to that folder and execute python whateveryounamedit.py while Minecraft is running.

e.g.
Download the script to /home/pi/mcpi/api/python/a.py

Open terminal
cd /home/pi/mcpi/api/python
python a.py


directions from:

To run the program, open up ‘LeafPad‘, copy this code into it and save it in /mcpi/api/python as a .py file.

Save it as rainbow.py. Then, once you have a MCPI world loaded up, open up

‘Terminal‘ and navigate to where you saved the file using cd and type python rainbow.py.
