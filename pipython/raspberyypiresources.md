MINECRAFT RASPBERRY PI PYTHON:
==============================

Sadly after some delving into these resources I have found there is a fair amount of dead wood.

even though etting and installing python/minecraft environment is possible the initial blogs

have just a few blogs, several years old that then sort of trail off.

there are around a dozen existing code efforts that can be used as examples however not updated much.

at this point I am looking into going straight into java scripting as in mods.
