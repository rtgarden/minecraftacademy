source material issues:
=======================

many of these resources were started with excitement by the contributor without much follow through.

I found much of the pippypi stuff to be decent as an introduction to python.

Not much follow through in maintaining code repositories or detailing lesson plans.

The node red stuff looks very promising however i need to do more hands on research.
