source material issues:
=======================

many of these resources were started with excitement by the contributor without much follow through.

I found much of the pippypi stuff to be decent as an introduction to python.

Not much follow through in maintaining code repositories or detailing lesson plans.

Javascript is used to create mods in Minecraft so there are some promising learn to javascript minecraft related
tutorials that I need to also look into. So far the two best options are python and javascript for combining the minecraft environment with a "how to code" lesson plan.

The node red stuff looks very promising however I need to do more hands on research.
