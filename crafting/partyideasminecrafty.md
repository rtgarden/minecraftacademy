Party Ideas:
=============

crafting activities:

*make some paper: 

save old egg cartons and newspaper to make paper

*make books: 

use existing paper and simple thread binding

* learn to use flint and steel to make a fire: use  youtube (or know any black powder enthusiasts?)

get the flints and steel on ebay

* get square lapis lazuli beads and make charms, necklaces or keychains with them. have all the needed findings.

also silver, gold, emerald, diamond, are all from the game.



* Paper Boats: make and float some paper boats. or even balsa wood.


*dye some wool: blue, yellow, red, pink, and grey are common game dye colors.

you could felt some plain cubes first. in general felting is a great minecraft activity.

*plant a garden: plant carrots, potatoes, wheat, pumpins, melons and bamboo.

foods from the game:
--------------------

whole red and gold apples, whole carrots with top, loaf of bread baguette style,

eggs (hardboiled), chocolate chip cookies,

whole actual sugar cane, baked potato, cooked chicken (roasted whole would be perfect), 

smoked fish, cooked pork and beef steak are all native foods to the game.

salmon lox and bread, square cake with white and red deco, green jello slime blocks,

watermelon (sliced), pumpkin pie, potion bottles "potion of enchanting" all work well.

a tray of brownies can easily be cut up and used for "dirt" blocks

you could all make and bake the pumpkin pie together

baked fish sticks and chicken sticks would also work fine.

for special candy:
------------------

blue diamonds: simple syrup/sugar candy with blueberry flavor and blue coloring

redstone dust or blocks: more like a taffy

gold bricks, foil wrapped chocolate (simple mold)

have a small target shoot set up and a few lightweight real target bows with easy arrows

use arm protection and caution on the range

*fishing for prizes:

can include small glass bottles, charms and prizes

*pin the tail on the donkey 

(there are donkeys in minecraft they are rare)

a nicely set up open tray of lego and table for building, make images for souveniers

*minecraft pinata:

have some printed craftable paper figures to make

save cardboard boxes to cover with minecraft paper as decoration

cover a wall with paper wrapped cereal boxes that are stuffed with different prizes

make the boxes cut open with an "X" in the front so that when they are paper wrapped

a simple "pick" will release the prizes
